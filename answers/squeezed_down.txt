An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even
though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited
allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should
we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with
the investor?

In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that
this could potentially happen less often?

Response
~~~~~~~~

Usually in all customer service complaints, we want to start by acknowledging their frustration. We then explain clearly
the reasoning behind the behavior they're encoutering. Communicate with them that the proration is put in place to allow
everyone a fair shot at the deal, highlighting the fact that investing consistently on our platform is important as it impacts
historical averages which in turn impact their future allocation.

At this point, I would want to reassure them that next time around their investment will be larger than $25K. Which we can
achieve by adding some sort of a weighted average (a multiplier) to their average_amount along with a cooldown, where it'll
automatically allow them to invest more than the other investors. And the cooldown will ensure that multiplier will go away
completely/slowly wane after a certain number of particiated deals.
- We can also tweak the algorithm to account for a base allocation for all investors, then a weighted allocation based on
historicals. This way everyone gets some money in, like $10K, and the rest is prorated as usual.
- For the bigger investors, we can also offer a VIP (or priority access) to deals ahead of time, or offer them a higher initial
allocation.

What's very important after making the change is to follow up with those angry investors to ensure they're happy with the change,
and if not, ask them for feedback on what they would like to see change.
